# steganography in wav file
I'm using windows 10 and python 3.8
if tkinter and cryptography are not installed on your computer install them using pip or on any preprable way.

For start I would say that the length of the text that can be encrypted depends on the wav file that choosed, as a practice you can download free wav sound effects on the following link:

## The GUI
For encrypt/decrypt buttons I used photos to make it look better but of course it's not an issue and you can use default tkinter buttons
